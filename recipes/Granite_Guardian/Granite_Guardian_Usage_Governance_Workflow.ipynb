        "IBM's [AI Risk Atlas](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=ai-risk-atlas) details and categorizes some of the risks of working with generative AI, foundation models, and machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why might it be important to you?\n",
        "The Risk Atlas can be helpful in determining the risk profile of a potential AI usecase. According to Michael Hind, Distinguished Research Staff Member in IBM Research, “The Risk Atlas enables risk managers, AI practitioners, and researchers to share a common AI risk vocabulary. It serves as a building block for risk mitigation strategies and new research technologies.”  The Risk Atlas can provide an structured entrypoint to linkages to IBM products, risk management tools and frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Find out more:**\n",
        " - Read the the IBM AI Ethics Board publication [Foundation models: Opportunities, risks and mitigations](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/E5KE5KRZ) which goes into more details about the risk taxonomy, and describes the point of view of IBM on the ethics of foundation models.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Augmenting Granite Guardian with AI Risk Atlas\n",
        "`Granite Guardian` models can help with risk detection along many key dimensions catalogued in IBM's AI Risk Atlas. `Granite Guardian` models are targeted for risk definitions of general harm, social bias, profanity, violence, sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, or groundedness/relevance for retrieval-augmented generation.  These risk definitions can be mapped to related risks in the AI Risk Atlas.  Risk detection results can be enhanced with information about AI risks drawn from IBM's [AI Risk Atlas](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=ai-risk-atlas).\n",
        "\n",
        "The AI Risk Atlas has been provided as a downloadable YAML file, which contains risks published in October 2024.\n",
